          <p class="card-text">It has been two on this code journey and i have learnt to be empathetic in the Leadership and personal development class
            ,to seek to understand first before iam understood,to focus on my area of influence but not that of concern,
            to always live by the decisions i make and take full responsibility, to think before i cant or judge and also that
            i dont always have a say in everying although they seem available, to always and always plan with the end in mind,
            to know my goals and inspirations and believe that i can, maintain a positive mindset, to be proactive always instead 
            of reactive, to put me first in a good and selfless way, to have a personal time table, to plan for the week and not
            comprise the calender unless if urgent and last but not least the emotional back account.
          </p>

          <p>
            I learnt about critical thinking and how we should not have assumptions and believe they are true because of
            the view from our perspective later alone jump to conclusions.And finally i learnt about coding html, css and 
            boostrap so far and as you can see this is my first website.The academy is excellent depending on my little exprience
